## FAQ

1. **Some files are being deleted and/or my anti-virus is detecting rbxfpsunlocker as malware. What do I do?**
Any detections are most likely a false positive. If you don't trust me, feel free to download the repository and compile the project from source. Otherwise, add an exception to your antivirus for `injector.exe` and `rbxfpsunlocker.dll` (or the folder they are both in).

2. **How do I fix "X dll is missing from your computer" or "The application was unable to start correctly" errors?**
Download and install [vc_redist.x86.exe](https://i.imgur.com/dDB1ifs.png) from Microsoft's website: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145
